Breakdown of stats by position. Average players (based on a given stat) are considered higher than the average at that position. Elite players (based on a given stat) are performing above 75% at that position

This is primarily a project I'm using to impove my data analytics skills.
There are several instances where I've left mistakes in to make it easier to review and find out what did and didn't work.
I'm hoping to add more to this as I progress, including a polished version with more of a "report" feel.

To the Champs League: Thank you for taking the time to look at this project.
I'm working to figure out the best way to get the data that you've said would 
be great to know. Any and all feedback is welcome and appreciated!
